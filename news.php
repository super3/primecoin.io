                <h3>Primecoin is unaffected by the alert system crisis</h3>
                <p>As explained above, the alert system is only a problem if a crypto-currency copied the alert system
                    code exactly from Bitcoin. Ethereum, for example, developed their own core codes and therefore would
                    not be affected. For altcoins, however, it takes developers incredible insight that allows them to
                    identify and understand the alert codes in the massive Bitcoin software, and foresight to realize
                    that it could be a problem in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sunny King, the creator of Peercoin, Primecoin, the concept of Proof of Stake(PoS) and alternative
                    Proof of Work (aPoW), had both. A volunteer developer of Primecoin, Harrye Tian, informed us that
                    Sunny King had already noticed and took care of the alert system issue back in 2013 when Primeocin
                    was initially released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reading into Primecion’s source codes released on Github, Harrye noticed that Primecoin was based on
                    Bitcoin version 0.8.6, which contained the alarm system codes. He then reached out to Sunny King,
                    who reassured him that the private key has been changed to a key that is only known to SK himself.
                    Even if Nakamoto’s key was revealed, Primecoin will remain unaffected.
                    Sunny King expressed his gratitude to Harrye for raising his concern and for his contribution to the
                    community, and the two discussed the future of Primecoin developments. Sunny King hopes that Harrye
                    Tian, together with other volunteers, will continue their effort on Primecoin and soon release an
                    updated version of Primecoin, improve its technology and security, add more functions and keep the
                    community active.

                <h3 id="advantages-xpm">The end message</h3>
                <p>It is believed that there are still many altcoins that have not updated their codes relating to the
                    alert system, and is still vulnerable to the release of Nakamoto’s private key. I hope this will
                    serve as a reminder to their developers to take action.
                    Furthermore, I believe that with the help of volunteers such as Harrye and others, alongside support
                    from Sunny King himself, Primecoin will catch up its lost time and evolve into a better and more
                    versatile platform. </p>
